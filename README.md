## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Test Automation Engineer with ~2.5 years of experience in Testing (Web & Embedded).  
Iâ€™m also pursuing my Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science Engineering at [Universitatea È˜tefan cel Mare](https://usv.ro/) from Suceava.

### A little about meâ€¦

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** building an application for reserving exam rooms using my universityâ€™s timetable endpoints, and creating a brand-new automation framework from scratch using **Selenium**, **Behave**, and **Pytest**.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** more advanced test automation strategies and delving deeper into building web apps.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** open-source automation projects and innovative testing solutions.
- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with** exploring new test coverage tools and best practices.
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** anything related to test automation (web or embedded).
- ðŸ“« **How to reach me**: Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn]([#](https://ro.linkedin.com/in/r%C4%83zvan-alexuc-b83714268)).
- âš¡ **Fun fact**: Chasing down bugs can feel like an endless game of whack-a-mole â€” you fix one, and three more pop up in its place!

Thanks for stopping by! Iâ€™m always excited to learn, collaborate, and share knowledge in the tech community.
